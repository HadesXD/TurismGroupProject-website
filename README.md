# Turism Website
This was a group project of mine in 2017, where we were given a website created by our teacher Islam Mušič. <br/>
We had to createa a series of .php files and update the look of the site a lot. <br/>
I would like to take a more in-depth look of this project in the future. <br/>

 <b>Using:</b>
- languages: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Haskell, SQL (MySQL)
- IDE: NetBeans 8.2

<b>To Do:</b>
- take an in-depth look into it
